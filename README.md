Molt Protocol is an adaptive economic system built around one idea:

**Growth requires shedding old shells.**

Inspired by biological molting, Molt Protocol introduces a mechanism where
token behavior changes form as conditions change — without breaking continuity.

Same core.  
New shell.

## Core Thesis

Most protocols fail because they remain static in dynamic environments.

Molt Protocol is designed to:
- adapt instead of resist
- shed inefficient mechanics
- reconfigure incentives as conditions evolve

The system does not restart.
It **moults**.

---

## The Molt Mechanism

Molt Protocol operates through **phases**, each representing a shell.

### Phase 1 — Soft Shell (Early / Fragile)
Used during low liquidity or early discovery.

- conservative buybacks
- minimal burn
- higher flexibility
- emphasis on survival

Goal: stay alive.

---

### Phase 2 — Hard Shell (Stable / Growing)
Activated when participation and stability increase.

- stronger buybacks
- controlled burn
- tighter fee routing
- reduced volatility exposure

Goal: consolidate structure.

---

### Phase 3 — Pre-Molt (Stress / Saturation)
Triggered by stress signals (volatility, drawdowns, inefficiency).

- throttled mechanics
- accumulation of reserves
- preparation for reconfiguration

Goal: prepare for change.

---

### Phase 4 — Molt Event (Reconfiguration)
The system sheds its current shell.

- parameters are updated
- routing rules change
- cadence resets
- old inefficiencies are removed

The protocol continues — **in a new form**.

---

## Signals (Inputs)

Molt phases are triggered by measurable signals:
- volatility regimes
- participation trends
- liquidity health
- fee efficiency
- sustained drawdowns or overheating

No emotion.
No narrative intervention.
Only signals.

---

## Design Principles

- Adaptation over rigidity
- Continuity over resets
- Constraints over promises
- Evolution over optimization

---

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — mechanism specs, phase definitions
- `scripts/` — simulations and stress tests
- `programs/` — future on-chain execution logic
- `apps/` — dashboards and transparency tools
- `packages/` — shared primitives

---

## Status

Molt Protocol is in the design and modeling phase.

This repository documents:
- adaptive mechanics
- phase transitions
- guardrails for safe evolution

---

## Closing

Staying the same is not stability.

Molt Protocol survives by changing.
